// plane. Most views here are taken from the port side, because that is the side the
// reference photograph shows. `fill` is how much of the frame the ship takes up: 1.0
// fits her bounding sphere exactly inside the field of view, so a close study is a
// number well below 1 and a whole-ship view is a little above it. Framing that way
// means a view keeps working when the ship changes size, and that the same view of the
// full suit and of the furled state is shot from the same place.
