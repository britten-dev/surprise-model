//
// Every other check in this repository proves something about geometry: the trace proves
// each dimension has a source, the audit proves the built ship matches it, the build
// proves the triangles fit and the verify proves the files load. None of them can tell
// whether the ship is alive, and that is exactly the failure the motion layer is prone
// to — because `src/ship/motion.js` finds what it moves **by name**.
//
// Rename `square_sails`, merge two groups in the rig, wrap the flags in a parent, and
// nothing throws. The ship simply stops moving. Every other check still passes, the GLB
// files are still perfect, and the loss is invisible until somebody happens to look at
// her in the viewer and thinks she seems a bit stiff.
//
// So this runs her for two instants and measures what changed. It is deliberately not a
// snapshot test: it asserts that things moved and that they moved by a sane amount, not
// that they moved to particular coordinates, because the amplitudes are meant to be
// tuned and a test that fights tuning gets deleted.
