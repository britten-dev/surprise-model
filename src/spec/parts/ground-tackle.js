// The datum for the anchors is Steel 1805, Folio LVI, "Dimensions and Weight of Anchors".
// The 32-gun column gives a bower of 34 cwt for a ship of Surprise's tonnage, and the
// stock-length row of the same folio is legible only for the larger classes. Research file
// 06 §13.2 carries that series down to the 32-gun column by cube-root-of-weight scaling
// from the 110-gun ship, which lands on 16 ft 6 in. Everything derived from that figure is
// marked RECONSTRUCTED and names the rule it used.
//
// Two things this file deliberately does not define, because another region already does
// and the two must agree: the cathead, whose position comes from the head module's
// `cathead_*` rows, and the fore channel's height, which comes from the channels module's
// `channel_top_below_rail`. The module reads both directly.
