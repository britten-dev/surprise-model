// Region specs. Each module that builds a region of the ship keeps its dimensions in
// its own file here, so that work on the head and work on the stern never touch the
// same source file. Every entry obeys the same shape as the core spec:
//
//   key: { value: <metres or degrees or a count>, source: '<GRADE> §n <where it came from>' }
//
// and every key must also appear as a row in SPECS.md, which `npm run trace` enforces.
