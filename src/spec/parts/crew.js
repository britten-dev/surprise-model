// The watch on deck.
//
// Nothing in this file is evidence about *this* ship, and it says so: every row is
// graded RECONSTRUCTED or FICTIONAL. What it is evidence about is people — the height of
// a British seaman in the 1790s is a well-recorded number, and it is the number that
// decides whether the ship reads at her real size. A ship with no one on her has no
// scale at all: she could be forty metres long or four, and the eye has nothing to
// measure her against. That is most of why a model looks like a model.
//
// Where they stand is the other half. In a gale, running before it, the watch is not
// spread evenly about the deck: it is at the wheel, at the con, at the lee braces, and
// otherwise under the weather rail keeping out of the water. Putting figures where the
// work is says more than putting more of them.
