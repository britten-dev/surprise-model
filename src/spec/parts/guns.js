// WHICH ARMAMENT. This file builds the Plymouth Dockyard establishment of June 1796:
// 24 long 9-pounders on the upper deck, 8 long 4-pounders and 4 twelve-pounder
// carronades on the quarterdeck, 2 long 4-pounders and 2 twelve-pounder carronades on
// the forecastle. Forty pieces, broadside 164 lb. That is the fit the reference
// photograph shows and the fit every published picture of her carries.
//
// THE ALTERNATIVE is the armament she is recorded as actually receiving on
// 21 April 1798 — 24 x 32-pdr carronades on the upper deck, 8 x 18-pdr carronades on
// the quarterdeck, 2 x 18-pdr carronades and 2 long 4-pdrs on the forecastle. That fit
// is better documented as what was aboard but rests on unpublished Navy Board
// correspondence, it needs wider and shallower ports than the hull now carries, and it
// is not what the photograph shows. Every row below that would change under it says so
// in its source field.
//
// A note on the shape rows. A period gun is not a tube: it steps down from the breech
// through two reinforces to the chase and swells again at the muzzle. Those steps are
// proportional to the bore, so they are recorded here as multiples of the calibre
// ("_cal") or as fractions of the barrel length ("_u"), which is how the founders'
// tables state them, rather than as metres that would be wrong for every other nature.
