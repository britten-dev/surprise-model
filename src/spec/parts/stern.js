// Two kinds of number live here. The stern *profile* — the tuck, the counter, the
// taffrail, the breadths of the transom — is MEASURED off the stern elevation that is
// superimposed on the body plan of ZAZ3067, as reported in research 05 §6. The
// *ornament* — the lights, the galleries, the carved work — is almost entirely
// RECONSTRUCTED, because no source states any of it for this ship. Every such row
// names the period rule it was built from.
//
// Heights are given above the design load waterline, which is y = 0. The draught is
// dimensioned above the moulded base line, which lies 12.83 ft below the LWL, so a
// figure quoted from the draught as "Z ft above base" appears here as Z - 12.83.
//
// Fore-and-aft positions are given as distances abaft the *tuck*, which the model
// places at the hull's aftmost station. The stern profile table in 05 §6 is
// self-consistent about those distances; its summary bullets are not, and quote a
// counter overhang (7.7 ft) and a taffrail overhang (10.5 ft) that its own measured
// points contradict. The measured points are used.
