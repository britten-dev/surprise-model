 * constantly — different at every station, every plank, every stain. That mismatch was
 * the single biggest reason a correctly coloured hull still read as shaded plastic:
 * nothing about how the light actually left the surface ever changed, only its colour
 * did. This keeps the strip's band structure, which is right and must not move — copper
 * is metal and the paint is not — and paints two more layers over it, in the same V
 * coordinate the colour bands use so that everything still lines up with the sheer
 * rather than the horizon:
 *
 *  * the same plank and sheathing pattern that gives the colour map its board-by-board
 *    unevenness, read again as a roughness delta instead of a lightness one, because a
 *    seam that catches a shadow is a real crack and holds less of a sheen than the
 *    smooth face beside it;
 *  * the weathering roughness `hullStains` paints at the same streaks and bands it
 *    paints its colour at, so the wind-and-water band is smoother where it is darker
 *    with weed and a rust run is rougher where it is darker with iron oxide, rather than
 *    the finish staying uniform under a hull whose colour is doing all the work.
 *
 * Metalness is never touched by either layer. `hullStains`'s roughness overlay in
 * particular has effects — the verdigris mottle above all — that sit entirely inside the
 * copper band, and blending it in the way the colour map blends its own weathering, with
 * `drawImage`, would carry the overlay's alpha into every channel including the blue one
 * metalness lives in: an innocent-looking rougher patch would quietly turn part of the
 * sheathing non-metal, which is exactly the regression the metal/paint distinction
 * exists to prevent. So this is built as a manual per-pixel blend that always takes
 * metalness from the band map alone and only ever reads roughness out of the overlay.
