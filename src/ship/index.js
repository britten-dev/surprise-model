/**
 * @param {object} [opts]
 * @param {string} [opts.lod]   'cinematic' | 'hero' | 'game' | 'distant'
 * @param {boolean} [opts.adaptiveDetail=false] Prepare lightweight fitting geometry for createDetailLOD.
 * @param {string} [opts.sails] 'full' | 'topsails' | 'storm' | 'furled'
 * @param {string} [opts.weather] 'fair' | 'heavy'. Defaults to heavy in the storm state.
 *   This is what a ship *does* about the weather, as against what she is wearing, and it
 *   is a long list: her gunports are shut and her guns housed, deadlights are shipped over
 *   the stern windows, the hatches are battened under tarpaulins, lifelines are rigged
 *   fore and aft for the people to hold by, the boats are double-gripped and the guns on
 *   the open decks have their tompions in. None of it is decoration — every item is
 *   something that, left undone, lets the sea into the ship or lets something heavy go
 *   adrift in her.
 * @param {string} [opts.ports] 'open' | 'shut'. Follows the weather unless it is given.
 *   It is separable because the two are not quite the same claim: a ship can be under her
 *   topsails in a rising sea with her ports already in.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.animatedSails=false] Keep separate fore-and-aft cloth for createSailHandling. Use full sails.
 * @param {'blue'|'white'|'red'} [opts.ensign='blue'] Naval squadron colours.
 * @param {number} [opts.flagYear] Select the pre/post-1801 Union; defaults to the 1798 specification.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.crew=true] Omit visible figures and their rendering cost when false.
