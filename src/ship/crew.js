// The watch on deck.
//
// Twelve figures do more for this ship than any other twelve thousand triangles in her,
// and not because anybody looks at them. They are what she is measured against. Without
// a man on her, a frigate is a shape with no size: the eye has nothing it knows the
// height of, so the gunports could be a foot high or four feet, and the whole ship reads
// as a model on a bench. Put one man at the wheel and every dimension on board is fixed
// at once.
//
// So they are built to be right at the two things that carry that: **height**, which
// comes from the muster rolls by way of the spec, and **posture**, which is what says
// these are people working a ship in a gale rather than mannequins set out on a deck.
// Nothing else about them matters much. Each is a few hundred triangles of jacket and
// tarpaulin, and at any distance where you could see a face there is a whole ship in the
// way of it.
//
// Every figure is its own Group with its arms as separate children, because
// src/ship/motion.js poses them: the helmsmen work the wheel, the men aloft sway with
// the mast, and everyone leans against the heel. A figure merged into the deck could not
// do any of that.
