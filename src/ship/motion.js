// Motion. The part of a ship that a still model cannot have.
//
// `buildShip` returns a ship that does not move, and that is deliberate: a GLB is a
// static thing and the host owns the hull's own heave, pitch and roll. But a ship whose
// every rope, sail and flag is welded to her hull is unmistakable however good the
// geometry is, because on a real ship *nothing above the deck is still*. The masts work,
// the shrouds swing, the canvas shivers, the ensign flies, the wheel turns and the men
// lean against the heel. Take all of that away and what is left reads as a model being
// carried through a scene, which is exactly what it is.
//
// So this is a layer laid over a built ship rather than a change to how she is built:
//
//     const ship = buildShip({ lod: 'game', sails: 'storm' });
//     const motion = createMotion(ship);
//     // each frame, after the host has moved the hull:
//     motion.update(t, { windSpeed: 24, heel: -0.18, pitch: 0.04, helm: -0.4, spray: 1 });
//
// `buildShip` is untouched, the GLB export is untouched, and a host that never calls
// this gets exactly the ship it had before.
//
// ## How the movement is done
//
// Three mechanisms, chosen per part by what that part is:
//
//  * **A vertex shader**, for everything aloft. The rig and the canvas are a handful of
//    merged meshes of tens of thousands of vertices with no nodes inside them to
//    animate, so the movement has to happen per vertex — and the processor has better
//    things to do with forty thousand triangles a frame.
//  * **Node transforms**, for the yards, the wheel and the men. All three are rigid, all
//    three have their own nodes, and moving a node is free. The yards are the important
//    one: sails.js hangs each square sail on its own yard rather than merging the suit
//    into one mesh, so bracing a yard brings its canvas round with it — which is what a
//    square rig is for, and what a merged suit makes impossible.
//  * **Rewriting the vertices**, for the three flags. A flag is a hundred and fifty
//    vertices and its exact surface is worth more than the microsecond that costs.
//
// ## The one rule that matters
//
// Everything aloft has to agree about **the whip**: how far the rig has swung out of
// line at a given height. If the shader's answer and the processor's answer differ by a
// centimetre, the topmen stand in mid-air and the ensign leaves the gaff. So it is
// written once, in `whipAt`, and the shader is handed the same expression in GLSL
// immediately below it. That is the only duplicated logic in this file, and the two are
// kept touching for exactly that reason.
//
// ## Why the shader works in the ship's frame and not the mesh's
//
// Every mesh in the rig carries a transform of its own: a mast is placed at its step and
// raked, a yard is placed at its slings and braced round. So a vertex's own `position.y`
// is not its height above the deck, and using it would bend each spar about its own
// origin rather than about the ship. The shader therefore recovers the height in the
// ship's frame from the model matrix, and applies the displacement in world space after
// the projection — which costs one dot product and one matrix multiply per vertex, works
// whatever transform a mesh happens to carry, and keeps working when the host rolls the
// whole ship over forty degrees.
