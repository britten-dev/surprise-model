// Weathering: the difference between a model of a ship and a ship.
//
// Everything in textures.js draws the ship as she left the dockyard — fair planking,
// clean paint, bright copper, new canvas. Nothing there has ever been to sea. This
// module draws what the sea does to her, and it is drawn as a separate layer rather
// than mixed into the paint for one reason: the paint is evidence and the dirt is not.
// PAINT carries sourced colours read off a photograph and off period practice, and a
// rust streak invented here must never be able to move one of them.
//
// So each generator below returns an RGBA overlay in the same coordinate space as the
// map it stains, and materials.js composites it on top. Alpha compositing rather than a
// blend mode, because the stains have to work in both directions: rust and slime darken
// a black topside, salt lightens it, and a multiply layer can only ever do the first.
//
// The three things that actually read at a distance, in order:
//
//  * **Streaks run downward from a fastening or an edge**, never at random. Every stain
//    on a ship's side is water that ran down from somewhere — a scupper, a port hinge,
//    a chain bolt, the wash of the sea itself — so a streak that begins in the middle of
//    a blank plank reads as a smudge on a texture, and one that begins under an ironwork
//    line reads as rust.
//  * **The waterline is the dirtiest line on the ship.** Weed and slime grow in the band
//    that is alternately wet and dry, and that band is wide on a ship running in a
//    seaway. It is the single strongest cue that a hull has been floating.
//  * **Nothing is uniform.** A stain of one strength everywhere is another kind of
//    clean. Every generator here works from a seeded random so that the density itself
//    varies along the ship.
