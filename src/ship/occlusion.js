// Baked ambient occlusion.
//
// Nothing built by the rest of this generator darkens where two surfaces meet. Every
// module here loves a straight normal and a clean silhouette, and the result is a ship
// lit correctly and shaded nowhere: a boat sits on its skids with no shadow under its
// keel, the inside of the bulwark is exactly as bright as the outside, a gun stands on
// the deck with nothing to say the deck is *under* it rather than merely behind it. A
// single key light finds none of that, because none of it is a change in the surface
// facing the light — it is two surfaces close enough to shade each other, which no
// amount of correct normal-mapping tells a renderer about on its own.
//
// This module fixes it the way an offline renderer would: by finding, once, at build
// time, how enclosed each vertex is by the rest of the ship, and writing the answer into
// the vertex colours everything already carries or can be given. It runs after
// `buildShip` has assembled the whole vessel, because it needs the finished geometry —
// the boats sited on their skids, the guns run out, the tops built onto the rig — and
// nothing here knows or cares which module put any of it there.
//
// ## Why a voxel grid and not a ray against the real triangles
//
// The honest way to ask "is this vertex enclosed" is to fire a ray and intersect it with
// the ship's own triangles. At the hero level that is a quarter of a million of them,
// and a vertex needs several rays, and there are hundreds of thousands of vertices to
// ask. That is a triangle-against-ray test repeated on the order of a hundred million
// times, which is not a build-time cost, it is a coffee-break cost.
//
// So the ship is voxelised first: rasterised, once, into a coarse occupancy grid over
// her whole hull. A ray then costs a handful of array reads along its length instead of
// a sweep over every triangle in the vessel, and the grid itself is cheap to build
// because the rasterisation is deliberately sloppy — each triangle just fills every cell
// its axis-aligned bounding box touches, rather than being clipped to the cells it
// actually passes through. That over-fills a little at a shallow grazing angle, but
// contact occlusion is a local, short-range effect by nature, not a precise shadow, and
// a cell or two of extra darkening at 0.3 m resolution is not a thing the eye can find.
//
// ## Why the target surface list is short
//
// A `THREE.Material` with `vertexColors: true` reads a `color` attribute that is not
// there for a mesh that never needed one, and an attribute this pass does not write is
// left at WebGL's default value for a disabled attribute, which is `(0, 0, 0, 1)` — not
// white. Flip a shared material to vertex colours and every mesh that uses it goes
// solid black unless every one of those meshes is given a colour attribute, painted or
// not. That is the trap in this feature, and it is why `paintOcclusion` below always
// writes a full white attribute before it darkens anything, and why the material list a
// few lines down is deliberately short rather than "everything": the rope, the sails and
// the glazing keep their plain materials, because a mesh this pass never touches can
// never go black by omission.
//
// Rope and canvas are left out for a second reason as well as the first: they are what
// `src/ship/motion.js` moves, a shroud swings and a sail's belly breathes, and contact
// occlusion baked onto a surface that changes shape under the vertex shader would be
// wrong the instant the wind picked up. Nothing this pass darkens is something the
// runtime motion layer ever repositions.
//
// ## Why the same short list also decides what can cast a shadow
//
// The first version of this pass voxelised the whole ship, rigging included, on the
// reasoning that a shroud still stands in the way of the light even though nothing
// darkens the shroud itself. It was wrong to build and easy to see was wrong: a frigate
// carries a couple of hundred lines from her channels to her mastheads, criss-crossing a
// few feet over most of the working deck, and a ray with 2-3 m to run finds one of them
// in almost every direction it tries. The result was not a shadow in the angle of the
// bulwark, it was every open plank of the deck reading a little dirty, everywhere, which
// is exactly the failure this brief warns against — contact occlusion is supposed to be
// local and specific, and general sky-visibility under a web of standing rigging is
// neither. So the rope, the canvas and the spars are absent from the occupancy grid as
// well as from the target list: only the solid fittings a boat, a gun or a body could
// actually rest against are allowed to shade one another.
//
// ## What "acceptable" costs on the guns
//
// `src/ship/guns.js` stands the battery on `THREE.InstancedMesh`, and a colour attribute
// on shared geometry is necessarily the same for every instance. This pass answers that
// by sampling occlusion once, at the first instance's placement, and using that one
// answer for the whole battery. A gun's own contact shadows — the barrel bedded in its
// carriage, the carriage's trucks meeting the deck — look the same wherever along the
// broadside the gun stands, so the approximation costs nothing a broadside actually
// shows; what it cannot do is notice that the aftermost gun sits closer to the tumblehome
// than the midship ones, which nothing here claims to answer anyway.
