// The head: everything forward of the ship's foremost station, plus the bulkhead that
// closes the forecastle behind it.
//
// Two ideas hold this module together.
//
// The first is that the head is a *profile*, not a solid. A shipwright draws the knee
// of the head as one fair curve on the sheer plan — the cutwater — and then hangs
// everything else off it: the rails run into the hair bracket at its head, the cheeks
// bolt to its sides, the gammoning passes through it, the figure stands on it. So the
// knee here is built as a two-dimensional outline extruded athwartships, and the
// outline is the only place the shape of the bow is decided.
//
// The second is that the fore end of the lofted hull is an open sliver the width of the
// keel, running the whole height of the ship. That is where the offset table stops. The
// stem timber is deliberately carried abaft the hull's foremost station so that its aft
// face caps that opening: after this module there is no hole at the bow. Everything is
// sited off model.fromStem(), model.pointAt() and model.featureYAt(), so all of it
// moves with the hull if the offsets change.
//
// The bowsprit is NOT built here — it belongs to src/ship/rig.js. What is built here is
// what it passes through: the knightheads, the partners, the chock and the gammoning
// cleats. The spar's line is reconstructed from bowsprit_heel_from_stem (this module's
// spec) and bowsprit_steeve_deg (the rig's), so the two agree without either module
// reaching into the other.
